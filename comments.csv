My lil bro got asthma one time and it is getting worse, (ok now my parent already got him in the hospital, But in my opinion we send him like a little too late) suddenly, at some point.. he passed out, the doctor tried everything, flick him on the knee, pinch him on the thigh and arm.. he didn&#39;t respond... so they had to rushed my lil to another (advanced) hospital... The fact that he managed to survive while getting him there is mind-blowing. Like the (advanced) hospital is about 1 hour, 30 minutes away.

You can play around for content all you want, but not when it comes to people’s lives. Pouring gas on the floor so carelessly in a gas station is one of the most stupid and irresponsible things I’ve seen him do, risking potential lives in the process. He should’ve told Tobi to move up a little bit instead of just pouring it on the floor to look “silly” and “be funny”.

@Belligerentpotatoes,2024-05-06T06:09:17Z,2024-05-06T06:09:17Z,0,For those who don’t know Ethan mentioned on twitter how bad it truly was. The man was in a resuscitation unit because nothing that is commonly used for asthma attacks was working. They definitely tried to lighten the severity to keep the video entertaining but I hope everyone gives Ethan good reception for this video,1
